# Python + Flask + MySQL - Shopping App DUSE
DUSE is a Dynamic Database-Driven Web Application developed using Python, Flask, and MySQL. Leveraging the user-friendly IDE, Replit, I orchestrated the backend functionalities. On the frontend, I employed HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing and responsive interface.

DUSE represents a culmination of innovative technologies and meticulous design, delivering a robust platform for users to explore and engage with a diverse range of products effortlessly.
